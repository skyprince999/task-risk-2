## Questions

It's always ok to ask questions. This task is large and full of creative potential. No one person will be an expert in every part of our final product, and that's okay. If you find an interesting answer to a problem, make that solution known and document where you found your answer, this will help the next person get up to speed even quicker.

!["I try not to make fun of people for admitting they don't know things, because for each thing 'everyone knows' by the time they're adults, every day there are, on average, 10,000 people in the US hearing about it for the first time. If I make fun of people, I train them not to tell me when they have those moments. And I miss out on the fun." "Diet coke and mentos thing? What's that?" "Oh man! We're going to the grocery store." "Why?" "You're one of today's lucky 10,000."](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ten_thousand.png)
